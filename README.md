# **WeDesign Task Management System Documentation**

## **Overview**

The WeDesign Task Management System is a console-based application written in C#. It allows users to manage tasks, including adding new tasks, updating existing tasks, marking tasks as completed, and viewing tasks by their due dates.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
Before you can install and run the WeDesign Task Management System, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **.NET SDK**: The .NET SDK is required to compile and run C# applications. You can download it from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet).
2. **A Code Editor or IDE**: 
   - Visual Studio Code (recommended)
   - Visual Studio
   - Rider, or any other C# compatible editor

### **Cloning the Repository**

git clone https://github.com/Putumani/task-management-system.git

## ** Navigate into the project directory**

`cd WeDesign/TaskManagement`

## **Building the Application**

Using the .NET CLI, navigate to the project directory where the .csproj file is located and run the following command:

`dotnet build`

This command will compile the source code into an executable program. If the build is successful, you should see output indicating that the build succeeded.


## **Running the Application**

After building the application, you can run it using the .NET CLI. Still within the project directory, execute the following command:

`dotnet run`

This will start the WeDesign Task Management System, and you will be presented with a menu in the console where you can perform various task management operations.
